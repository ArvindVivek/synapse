# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-01-28)

**Core value:** Turn-by-turn draft recommendations with transparent reasoning that help coaches make better pick/ban decisions in real time.
**Current focus:** Phase 1 - Data Foundation

## Current Position

Phase: 1 of 6 (Data Foundation)

Progress: [█░░░░░░░░░] 6% (1/17 plans complete)

## Performance Metrics

**Velocity:**
- Total plans completed: 1
- Average duration: 6 min
- Total execution time: 0.1 hours

**By Phase:**

| Phase | Plans | Total | Avg/Plan |
|-------|-------|-------|----------|
| 1 - Data Foundation | 1/3 | 6 min | 6 min |

**Recent Trend:**
- Last 5 plans: 6min

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- [Roadmap]: 6-phase structure covering data pipeline through deployment
- [Roadmap]: Heuristics-first approach for recommendations (no heavy ML)
- [Roadmap]: Risk mitigations from PITFALLS.md integrated into each phase
- [01-01]: Use Bottleneck for rate limiting instead of custom solution (battle-tested, handles edge cases)
- [01-01]: Store role_confidence scores for multi-signal role inference (flex picks need probabilistic scoring)
- [01-01]: Add etl_checkpoints table for resumable ETL jobs (30-60 min runtime needs checkpoint recovery)
- [01-01]: Use Zod for GRID API response validation (catch schema changes early)

## Quick Reference

**Timeline:** 7-8 days (Cloud9 x JetBrains Hackathon)
**Stack:** Next.js 16 + React 19 + Supabase + Vercel
**Data Source:** GRID.gg API (1,500-2,000 professional games)

**Phase Overview:**
1. Data Foundation - GRID API, Supabase schema, ETL
2. Core Analytics - Champion stats, synergies, matchups
3. Draft State Machine - Real-time state, turn validation
4. AI/Heuristics Engine - Recommendations, predictions, win-rate
5. Draft Simulator UI - LoL-authentic interface
6. Polish and Deploy - Performance, demo, submission
